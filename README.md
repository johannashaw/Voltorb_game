# Voltorb_game
A recreation of the Voltorb minigame from Pokemon Soul-Silver


The PCB was designed to incorperates a 5x5 button matrix and have the game displayed on an OLED using I2C interfacing. 



The Software component was designed to be used with the ATmega328P-P microchip and the SSD1306 OLED.


SSD1306, I2C, timer, atd, and sci libraries were all provided to me by Simon Walker.
